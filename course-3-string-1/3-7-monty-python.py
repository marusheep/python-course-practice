# Programming Challenge: Monty Python
# In a .py file, create a program and use input()
# three times to get answers to the following questions from a user.  Store each of the answers in a variable.
#
# 1. What is your name?
# 2. What is your quest?
# 3. What is your favorite color?
# 4. Then, concatenate everything into a string within a print() statement
#    with the form "So your name is [name], your quest is [quest], and your favorite color is [color]."

varGuestName = input("What\'s your name?")
varGuest = input("What\'s your quest?")
varColor = input("What\'s your favorite color?")
print("So your name is " + varGuestName +", your guest is " + varGuest + ", and your favorite color is " + varColor + ".")
